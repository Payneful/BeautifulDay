# Overview

This project pulls information from the Estes Park Weather website to give you different temperatures for different dates. This allowed me to pull that information and make a simple ui to interact with so you can choose what month and year you would like to look at. This project will use pandas and python to pull this data and after which it will be saved to a csv file for later viewing if you wish.

# Data Analysis Results

It is very fascinating to look at the weather and how things can change so much from year to year. In my software it allows you to see different months and see the data that was given to generate the weather. It varies so much from year to year, but it is all easily read through my simple program. Unfortunately my page only had weather going back to 2005, but it works really good.
